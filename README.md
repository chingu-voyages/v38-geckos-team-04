## Overview

One difficulty in learning how to code is figuring out which project to build to improve your skills. Most tutorials simply build a to-do app. Develapp takes you beyond to-do list apps and helps you find projects you can build and be proud to include in your portfolio. Develapp is made for you so that you can **always be building**.

This project was built by a remote team during the `chingu` voyage 38.

## Acknowledgements 👏👏👏
This app is based off of `Florin Pop's` repository found [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). It is an amazing resource for this project. Whereas, the repository has an `MIT license`, which permits us to use it for free, nevertheless, we still wanna say **thank you** to `Florin Pop` for putting it out there.

Last, but not the least, is `Jim Medlock`, who incidentally is mentioned as a contributor in `Florin Pop's` repository [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas#main-contributors-). The gratitude is apparently two-fold:
- for the app ideas repo
- for the project showcase.
