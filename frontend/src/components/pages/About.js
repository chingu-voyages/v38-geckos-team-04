            One difficulty in learning how to code is figuring out which project to build 
            to improve your skills. Most tutorials simply build a to-do app. Develapp takes 
            you beyond to-do list apps and helps you find projects you can build and be proud 
            to include in your portfolio. Develapp is made for you so that you can always be 
            building. This project was built by a remote team during the chingu voyage 38.
