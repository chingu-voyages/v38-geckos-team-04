/* 
This is a controller file. In the MVC framework, the Model (business logic, data)
is separated from the Views (the user facing logic). However, sometimes the Views needs
to communicate with the Model to get data to display. In that situation, it is the 
Controller that bridges the gap. The Controller talks to the Model and sends that response
to the Views.
